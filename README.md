Introduction to Python

This repository serves as a structured portfolio of Python programming work, demonstrating a strong foundation in core language concepts, problem-solving, and software development practices.

The content is organised by topic and reflects a progression from basic syntax and control flow to more advanced concepts such as object-oriented programming, error handling, testing, file processing, and the use of libraries.

Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to present a clear and well-organised Python portfolio that demonstrates:
- Understanding of fundamental programming concepts
- Ability to structure and maintain readable code
- Experience with testing and validation
- Familiarity with commonly used Python libraries

--------------------------------------------------

Technologies Used

- Python 3
- pytest
- Python Standard Library
